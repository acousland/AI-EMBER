Bushfre sprinklers
Sprinklers may help protect your house
but have limitations. You need to ensure:
⊲ all openings on the roof are protected
for the duration of the ember attack.
Sarking or gap sealing can be more
efective.
⊲ that the sprinklers fully cover the area
of your house exposed to fre. This
includes roofs, doors, windows and
decks.
Important: Seek professional advice for
selecting and installing the appropriate
sprinkler system for your building.
