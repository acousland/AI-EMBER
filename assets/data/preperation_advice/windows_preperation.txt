Windows
If windows break, they let embers into the home. Once this happens fres can spread very quickly. Bad fre days are
windy days so try to protect your windows from embers and other debris. You could use:
⊲ Fire shutters
⊲ Toughened glass (minimum 5mm thickness).
Heat can break glass. You can reduce the heat against your windows by removing shrubs and fammable mulch
from under or around them.
The best window frames are made from non-combustible materials such as metal or fre-resistant timber. If you
have timber frames, make sure they are well maintained and painted.
