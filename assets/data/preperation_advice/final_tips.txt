Don’t leave things until the last minute. If you know a hot, dry,
windy day is coming, start getting your property ready:
 Remove doormats from around the house
 Move combustible outdoor furniture and other items from decks, up against, or under
the home
 Move pot plants a few metres from the home
 Double check that gas bottles are anchored securely with the relief valves pointing
away from any fammable materials
 Mow your lawns. On bigger properties, a clearing of about 10 metres of well-mown
grass around your home is advisable
 Walk around your home and remove piles of fne fuels such as leaves. It will probably
be where embers will land
 Check your gutters to make sure leaves haven’t built up
 Make sure you remove any fuels from around your windows and doors. These are
the most vulnerable parts of your home
 Make sure trees on your property are healthy with no dead limbs and no vegetation
underneath them
 Ensure your insurance is sufcient and current.
