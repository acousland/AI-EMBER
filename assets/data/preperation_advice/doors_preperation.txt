Doors
⊲ Most modern doors can easily catch fre – you
should aim to have a door made from solid timber or
non-combustible materials
⊲ Seal any gaps to stop embers getting inside
⊲ Never leave your doormat outside the door on high
fre-risk days
⊲ If you have a fy-screen, the frame should be metal
or non-combustible material, and the screen should
be made of corrosion resistant bronze or steel mesh
(maximum aperture of 2mm)
⊲ Any glazing should be toughened glass with
minimum thickness of 6mm

Open and unscreened doors
pose an extreme risk.
Embers lodging on combustible door sills and
gaps around door frames pose a high risk.
Screened doors
Installing metal screen doors over timber doors
will reduce the chance of an ember igniting the
door.
