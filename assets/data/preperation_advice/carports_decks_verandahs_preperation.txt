Carports/decks/
verandahs
⊲ If you live in a high fre-risk area, it’s best to construct
decks, carports or verandahs using non-combustible
materials.
⊲ If these structures are timber, make sure they’re well
maintained and note where leaves naturally gather,
as this will probably be where embers land.
⊲ Make sure you remove all fammable items such as
outdoor furniture and pot plants before bad days.
⊲ Try to keep shrubs and plants away from any timber
structures.
