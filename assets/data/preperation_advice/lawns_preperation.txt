Lawns
and garden beds
⊲ Keep lawns between 5cm and 10cm. This means
they are short enough to minimise fuel for fre but
they can retain moisture.
⊲ Where possible keep garden beds away from the
house.
⊲ Try to mulch garden beds within 10 metres of the
house with stones not fammable materials. Wooden sleepers
⊲ Keep garden beds clear of weeds and remove any
dead vegetation. History has shown that wooden sleepers can
smoulder for days after fres have passed
through properties. In hot and windy conditions,
this could cause fne fuels such as mulch and
leaves to catch fre. Use non-combustible
materials for garden beds and retaining walls
such as concrete or large rocks. It will give your
home extra protection if you can’t access your
property after a fre.
