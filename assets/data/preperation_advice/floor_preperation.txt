Floors
Many houses catch fre from embers. One major
problem is when embers get under sub-foors,
especially when wood or other fammable objects are
stored under the house.
To stop this happening, you need to seal your sub-
foor. Make sure there are no gaps. Non-combustible
materials such as masonry, brick veneer, mud brick or
concrete are the best materials to use.
If your sub-foor isn’t enclosed, there are two things you
can do to reduce your risk from embers:
⊲ Remove all fammable materials from under the
house
⊲ Seal any gaps using mesh or perforated sheet made
of corrosion resistant bronze or steel (maximum
aperture of 2mm).

Open and unscreened
windows pose an
extreme risk.
Installing wire mesh screens (not aluminium)
with 1.5mm holes over both the window
and frame can prevent embers touching
the glass or timber. This can also be an
efective method for refecting radiant heat.
